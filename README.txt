## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

A simple multi-page website demo was for a recent client I had that uses CSS3 and HTML5. The design was from a template that the client agreed upon to speed up the process and save money. The JS portion will be a location feature where I plan to integrate a Mapquest API. 

## Optimizations
*(optional)*
Next time I will use React to avoid repetition of code.

## Lessons Learned:

Test code more often before pushing to my GitHub account to save time from debugging.
