## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

A simple multi-page website demo was created for a recent client using CSS3 and HTML5. The design was based on a template that the client agreed upon to speed up the process and save money. The JS portion will be a location feature where I plan to integrate a Mapquest API.

## Optimizations

Next time I will use React to avoid repetition of code.

## Lessons Learned:

Test code more often before pushing it to my GitHub account to save time from debugging.
